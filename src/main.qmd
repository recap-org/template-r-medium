# Introduction

This paper aims to analyze the relationship between students' exam scores and various predictors such as hours studied, sleep hours, attendance percentage, and previous scores. @Doe found that hours studied and attendance percentage were significant predictors of exam scores [@Doe]. This analysis seeks to validate and extend those findings using a more comprehensive dataset.

# Results

```{r}
#| label: analysis
#| tbl-cap: Regression table

models <- list(
  lm(exam_score ~ previous_scores, data = df),
  lm(exam_score ~ hours_studied + sleep_hours + attendance_percent + previous_scores, data = df)
)
```

```{r}

m # show the table in the quarto report
```

```{r}

#| fig-cap: Coefficient plot
